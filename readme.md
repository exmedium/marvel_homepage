I'm not as familiar with trying to get information through a series of api calls,
rather than writing an api endpoint (in Php) that returns the data that I want to ingest,
in a format that is easily parsed.

As such I ran into an issue with sending further requests:
{
  "code": "RequestThrottled",
  "message": "You have exceeded your rate limit.  Please try again later."
}
that is still not allowing me new calls so I can move forward.

So until that limit has passed, (hopefully over the weekend),
I'll not be able to make much progress on this.

It is my hope that:
1. You will take into account the work that actually was done, and its responsivness.
2. You will see that I was heading in the correct direction to deal with the API.
3. You will allow that the timeframe was a bit short for the task.

Side note,
the structure of the components with each in its own folder,
is to allow each folder to hold it's own css, tests, etc.

I'll likely complete this excercise as soon as I'm again able to hit the API,
and finish the expected work.
